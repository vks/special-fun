# special-fun

[![Build Status]][actions]

Special functions for Rust by binding to the [Cephes library][1].

The following families of functions currently have Rust bindings for `f32` and
`f64`:

* Bessel functions
* Beta functions
* Error functions
* Gamma functions
* Hypergeometric functions
* Zeta functions
* Normal probability distribution

Cephes implements a lot more functions that are not yet exposed in the Rust
interface.

⚠️ **Cephes defines some symbols that may conflict with libc, such as `sin` and `cos`.
Using this crate may overwrite these symbols!**


## Installing

Cargo is used to build the included Cephes library (which is written in C) and
to create a Rust library that statically links to Cephes.


## License

The bindings and the Cephes library use the BSD license.
The author of Cephes (Stephen Moshier) has agreed to this.


## Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the work by you shall be licensed as above, without any
additional terms or conditions.

  implemented and only supports `f64`.
